 A System Dynamics Approach for Cybersecurity Forecasting

This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning–based system for detecting and forecasting software vulnerabilities. The project forms part of an academic dissertation and explores the use of supervised learning models—Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)—to classify and analyse vulnerabilities using a publicly available dataset from Kaggle.

 Overview
The project focuses on:
- Preprocessing and cleaning vulnerability data  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature encoding and normalization  
- Training ML models (Logistic Regression, KNN)  
- Evaluating model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
